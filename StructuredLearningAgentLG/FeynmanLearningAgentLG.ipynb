    "## Structured Learning Agent using LangGraph\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a structured learning agent using LangGraph. The system will guide learners through a structured learning process of defined but customizable checkpoints. Verifying understanding at each step and providing feynman-style teaching when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "- Access to personalized 1:1 tutoring is expensive and not accessible to everyone.\n",
    "- Provide individualized learning experience to each learner and feedback 24/7.\n",
    "- Use own notes and web-retrieved content as context.\n",
    "- Offer patient, simple explanations of complex topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. Learning State Graph: Orchestrates the sequential learning workflow.\n",
    "2. Checkpoint System: Defines structured learning milestones.\n",
    "3. Web Search Integration: Dynamically retrives relevant learning materials.\n",
    "4. Context Processing: Chunks and process learning materials.\n",
    "5. Question Generation: Creates checkpoint-specific verification questions.\n",
    "6. Understanding Verification: Evaluates learner comprehension with a clear threshold.\n",
    "7. Feynman-style Teaching: Provides patient, simple explanations of complex topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "The system follows a structured learning cycle.\n",
    "1. Checkpoint Definition\n",
    "* Generate sequential learning milestones with clear success criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Context Building\n",
    "* Processes student-provided materials or retrieves relevant web content.\n",
    "3. Context Validation\n",
    "* Validates context based on checkpoint criteria.\n",
    "* Performs additional web searches if context doesn't meet criteria.\n",
    "4. Embedding Storage\n",
    "* Stores embeddings for retrieving only relevant chunks during verification.\n",
    "5. Understanding Verification\n",
    "* Generates checkpoint-specific questions.\n",
    "* Evaluates learner's answers against correct answers.\n",
    "* Provides clear feedback on understanding level.\n",
    "6. Progressive Learning\n",
    "* Advances to the next checkpoint when understanding is verified.\n",
    "* Provides Feynman-style teaching when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "This structured learning agent provides a personalized, 24/7 learning experience. It can be easily extended to include additional features such as progress tracking, personalized recommendations, and more.\n",
