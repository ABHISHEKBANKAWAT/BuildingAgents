    "## Scientific Paper Agent using LangGraph\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "This project implements an intelligent research assistant that helps users navigate, understand, and analyze scientific literature using LangGraph and advanced language models. By combining various academic API with sophisticated paper processing techniques, it creates a seamless experience for researchers, students, and professionals working with academic papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation \n",
    "Reduce the time people invest in R&D and reading, analyzing and synthesizing academic papers. \n",
    "Key Challenes include - \n",
    "* Extensive Time commitment \n",
    "* Inefficient search processes accross fragmented database ecosystems\n",
    "* Complex task synthesizingand connecting findings across multiple papers\n",
    "* Stay current with new publications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. State-Driven Workflow Engine\n",
    "* StateGraph Architecture: Five-node system for orchestraded research.\n",
    "* Decision making node: Query intent analysis and routing.\n",
    "* Planning Node: Research Stategy formulation.\n",
    "* Tool Execution Node: Paper Retrievel and processing.\n",
    "* Judge Node: Quality validation and improvement cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Paper Processing Integration\n",
    "* Source Integration, CORE API for Comprehensive paper access.\n",
    "* Document Processing, PDF content extraction, Text Structure preservation.\n",
    "3. Analysis Workflow\n",
    "* State-aware processing pipeline\n",
    "* Multi-step validation gates\n",
    "* Quality-focused improvement cycles.\n",
    "* Human-in-the-loop validation options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method details\n",
    "#### The system requires\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gemini API Key.\n",
    "- CORE API key for paper retrieval. CORE is one of the larges online repositories for scientific papers, counting over 136 million papers, and offers a free API for personal use. A key can be requested here.\n",
    "#### Technical Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangGraph for state orchestration.\n",
    "- PDFplumber for document processing.\n",
    "- Pydantic for structured data handling."
